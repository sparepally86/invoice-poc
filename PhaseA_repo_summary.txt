Invoice POC — Phase A (Repository Summary

Context
- This repository contains the Phase A implementation of an Agentic AP Automation Proof-of-Concept (Invoice POC).
- Phase A has been completed per your PhaseA_Summary and supporting schema docs: deterministic rule-based agents, orchestrator, minimal UI for HITL, and MongoDB persistence.

High-level architecture (as implemented)
- Orchestrator: central router and status manager responsible for routing AgentRequest -> AgentResponse, coordinating workflow steps, and creating HITL tasks when required.
- Agents:
  - ValidationAgent: deterministic checks for required fields, correct data types, threshold checks, returns {valid:true|false, issues:[...]} and routes to POMatchingAgent or HITL.
  - POMatchingAgent: deterministic 2-way PO matching with configurable tolerance; returns {po_found, match_score, tolerance_exceeded}.
  - CodingAgent: rule-based GL and cost-center assignment; returns coding payload for invoice lines.
  - RiskApprovalAgent: evaluates risk and determines approval requirement (auto-post vs requires human approval).
- HITL / Tasks: orchestrator creates tasks for failed validation, PO mismatches, missing vendor mapping, or risk approvals. Tasks are exposed via APIs and handled in the UI.
- Data stores: MongoDB collections for vendors, pos (PO master), invoices (with workflow steps), and tasks.
- Web UI: pages/dashboards for invoice submission, journey view, tasks (HITL), invoice detail with approve/reject actions, and a dev generator for sample invoices.
- APIs: endpoints implemented include (but may not be limited to):
  - POST /api/v1/incoming — submit invoice (ingest & orchestrate)
  - GET /api/v1/invoices/{id} — fetch invoice
  - GET /api/v1/invoices/{id}/events — SSE stream for live journey
  - POST /api/v1/invoices/{id}/approve — approve invoice → READY_FOR_POSTING
  - GET /api/v1/tasks — fetch HITL tasks
  - POST /api/v1/tasks/{id}/action — approve/reject task
  - CRUD endpoints for /vendors and /pos
  - POST /api/v1/dev/generate-invoice — dev utility for generating invoices

Agent IO & Contracts
- All agents use a common envelope for AgentRequest and AgentResponse to ensure consistent orchestration and routing.
- Examples (from repository docs):
  - AgentRequest: { invoice_id, payload, context: {status, history, received_at} }
  - AgentResponse: { agent, invoice_id, status, result, next_agent, score, errors, timestamp }
- Agents post back results to an invoice-level _workflow.steps[] array for auditability and traceability.

Phase A Deliverables (already implemented)
- Orchestrator skeleton (queue + worker pattern) and central routing ✅
- ValidationAgent and POMatchingAgent (deterministic) ✅
- CodingAgent and RiskApprovalAgent (rules-based) ✅
- HITL task creation and basic task flows/UI ✅
- MongoDB persistence with vendors, pos, invoices, tasks ✅
- SSE-based live journey/event stream for invoice status updates ✅
- Basic dev utilities (invoice generator endpoint) and CRUD for masters ✅

Notes / Observations (items to check in repo)
- CI: confirm whether there is an existing GitHub Actions workflow for tests/linting; if missing, add a minimal CI to run unit tests.
- Tests: look for unit tests for agents and orchestrator; if absent, add targeted tests (ValidationAgent, POMatchingAgent).
- Packaging: confirm repo structure (src/ vs notebooks) and dependency management (requirements.txt vs poetry).
- Security: ensure no secrets are checked in and that DB credentials are environment-driven.

Recommended next steps (Phase B bootstrap)
- Add a Vector DB and ingestion pipeline for historical docs (RAG).
- Implement a RAG-powered ExplainAgent to fetch evidence for human reviewers.
- Integrate LLM-assisted vendor disambiguation flows (LangChain-style).
- Add a metrics/observability baseline: basic metrics for routing failures, agent latencies, task volumes.
- Introduce a CI gate for merges (tests pass) before enabling auto-posting.

Purpose of this PR
- Add a concise repo-level summary reflecting the current Phase A implementation and serve as a single-source high-level description for reviewers and contributors as we transition to Phase B.
